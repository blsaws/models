# route but ``eth0`` is the public interface.  They are auto-detected in
# ``stack.sh`` but often is indeterminate on later runs due to the IP moving

# Logging
# -------

# By default ``stack.sh`` output only goes to the terminal where it runs.  It can
# be configured to additionally log to a file by setting ``LOGFILE`` to the full
# path of the destination log file.  A timestamp will be appended to the given name.

# Nova logs will be colorized if ``SYSLOG`` is not set; turn this off by setting
# ``LOG_COLOR`` false.

# Using git versions of clients
# -----------------------------
# By default clients are installed from pip.  See LIBS_FROM_GIT in

# LIBS_FROM_GIT="python-ironicclient"
# IRONICCLIENT_BRANCH=refs/changes/44/2.../1

# The Identity API v2 is deprecated as of Mitaka and it is recommended to only use the v3 API.
# It is possible to setup keystone without v2 API, by doing:
