This folder contains scripts etc to setup a kubernetes cluster with the following type of environment and components:
* hardware
  * 2 or more bare metal servers  * two connected networks (public and private): may work if just a single network  * one or more disks on each server: ceph-osd can be setup on an unused disk, or a folder (/ceph) on the host OS disk* Kubernetes  * single k8s master (admin) node  * other cluster (k8s worker) nodes* Ceph: backend for persistent volume claims (PVCs) for the k8s cluster, deployed using Helm charts from https://github.com/att/netarbiter* Helm on k8s master (used for initial cluster deployment only)  * demo helm charts for Helm install verification etc, cloned from https://github.com/kubernetes/charts and modified/tested to work on this cluster* Prometheus: server on the k8s master, exporters on the k8s workers* Cloudify CLI and Cloudify Manager with Kubernetes plugin (https://github.com/cloudify-incubator/cloudify-kubernetes-plugin)* OPNFV VES Collector and Agent* OPNFV Barometer collectd plugin with libvirt and kafka support* As many components as possible above will be deployed using k8s charts, managed either through Helm or Cloudify
A larger goal of this work is to demonstrate hybrid cloud deployment as indicated by the presence of OpenStack nodes in the diagram below.
See comments in [setup script](k8s-cluster.sh) and other scripts in the for more info.
This is a work in progress!
